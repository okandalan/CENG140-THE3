# METU CENG140 TAKE HOME EXAM 3
This is the solution for the programming assignment of the CENG140, C course.

This assignment tests linked list, struct, pointer and dynamic memory allocation knowledge.

The problem is

"The Internet comes with cables until our wireless modem in our home, and there is a bandwidth value which
is related to how much money you pay for your Internet connection for each month. You are going to create a
basic Internet connection mapping in a sample street"

You can find what the tasks are and functions do in the .pdf file, but brief explanation is that circular and double linked list whose nodes are struct are implemented to mapping internet connection and 
functions make some operations on this mapping such as remove, add or merge.
